Hi! I'm Timothy Ng, but most people call me Tim. I graduated from UC Davis with a BS in Mathematics in 2023 and am looking forward to attending UC Irvine to study Data Science for my Master's degree.

I'm fascinated by machine learning and data science, and I want to improve my programming skills by making random projects.

You can reach me at timothy.ng681@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-ng-047188142/

Check out my projects in the meantime, and I'll try to keep things updated!
