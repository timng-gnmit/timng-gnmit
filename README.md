Hi! I'm Timothy Ng, but most people just call me Tim. I'm currently pursuing my Master of Data Science at the University of California, Irvine, and I expect to graduate in December 2025. I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of California, Davis in June 2023.

I love math and am fascinated by its applications in machine learning and data science, and I want to improve my programming skills by making random projects (hopefully to be uploaded here).

You can reach me at timothy.ng681@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-ng-047188142/

Check out my projects in the meantime, and I'll try to keep things updated! I have a website now - [timng-gnmit.github.io](timng-gnmit.github.io)
